This is a customizable, self-learning AI chatbot. Unlike standard bots that are "fixed," you can teach this bot new topics, update its existing knowledge, or delete things it shouldn't know—all while chatting.

Works:
1. Start Up: When you launch the chatbot, it takes a moment to "wake up" and review everything it knows to ensure its memory is up to date. Then, it greets you (e.g., "Welcome! I'm Tesla...").
2. Listening: The bot waits for you to type a message and press Enter.
3. Processing (The Brain): When you type a sentence, the bot instantly analyzes it. It ignores punctuation, breaks your sentence into key words, and simplifies them (for example, it knows that "running" and "run" mean the same thing).
4. Thinking & Answering: The bot compares your words against everything it has learned.
    If it is confident (>90%): It understands what you mean (the "topic") and replies with one of its prepared responses for that topic.
    If it is unsure: It admits it doesn't understand ("I don't understand that yet") and automatically switches to Learning Mode.
5. Learning Mode: Instead of just giving up, the bot asks for your help to get smarter. It will ask you for three things:
    The Topic: What is this conversation about? (e.g., "SpaceX")
    The Patterns: What are some ways you might ask about this? (e.g., "Tell me about rockets")
    The Response: What should it say back to you? (e.g., "SpaceX designs rockets.")
6. Auto-Update: Once you provide the new info, the bot:
    Saves the new knowledge to its memory.
    "Studies" the new information instantly.
    Restarts the conversation automatically so you can immediately ask the exact same question again—and this time, it will know the answer.
