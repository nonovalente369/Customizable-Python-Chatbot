A customizable, self-learning AI chatbot built with Python and PyTorch. Unlike standard "fixed" bots, this AI features Active Learning: if it encounters a question it doesn't understand, it enters a "Teaching Mode" where you can define the topic, potential questions, and correct answers. The bot then instantly retrains its model and reloads, allowing the conversation to continue seamlessly.
